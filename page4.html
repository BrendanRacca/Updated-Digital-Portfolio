            <h3><u>Hobbies</u></h3>
            <p> From an early age, I have enjoyed creating my own stories. While a book would be easier to write than 50+ hours of gameplay, I feel that the story is more enjoyable when fully visualized for the audience. However, because very detailed stories like those that I enjoy are too long to effectively fit into a movie, and in some cases, an entire series, it would be more immersive to allow the audience to view it at their own pace. Just like everyone else ever, I also enjoy video games. I am currently studying web development, not only as a prerequisite for game design classes, but so I can become proficient at writing code as well as stories.</p>

            <p> During my time at CART, I have learned how to code using both html and CSS. I have also learned how to create Adobe Spark pages and customize Mood Boards. I am literate and able to speak in Spanish. I even qualified for both Honors Chemistry and AP Composition last year. You can read more about me on my LinkedIn page.
